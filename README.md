I built an awesome dictionary app using TypeScript, It fetches words meaning from the Free Dictionary API (https://dictionaryapi.dev/) allowing users to search and get detailed info like its meaning, part of speech (noun, adjective, etc.), synonyms, sources and even pronunciation in sound. You can also toggle between dark and light themes, change the font style with 3 options and more..
